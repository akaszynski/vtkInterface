Jupyter Notebook Plotting
=========================

The PyVista module supports a variety of backends when plotting within
a jupyter notebook:

* Server-side rendering with PyVista streaming to the notebook through ``ipyvtk_simple``
* Client-side rendering with ``itkwidgets``.
* Client-side rendering with ``ipygany``.
* Server and Client-side rendering with ``panel``.
* Static images.
